### What is Snapshot

A snapshot is a way of making a copy of a disk state of an Nectar instance so the state can be preserved at a particular time.  It is easy to create a snapshot of root disk of a instance or volume by using the snapshot dialog from the  [Nectar dashboard](https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au). 
 
 In this tutorial, you are going to learn how to take snapshots of instances and volumes. Then, we are going to re-create the state of the instances and volumes out of the snapshots.
